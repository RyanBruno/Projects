Exodus
===
---

Exodus tells the story of God liberating the enslaved
[Israelites](../The_Israelites)
from Egypt with [Moses](../Moses) as their leader.
God then enters into a [covenant](../Covenant) with
the Israelites at
[Mount Sinai](../Mount_Sinai).

Exodus is the second
[books of the Bible](../Books_of_the_Bible).
It continues the story of the descendants of
Abraham which God had made a
[covenant](../Abrahams_Covenant) with.
As we left off in
[Gensis](../Gensis) God\'s people are not in the land promised to
Abraham but stuck in Egypt.

#### The Ten Commandments

At this point The [Israelites](../Israelites) were out of harms way from
the Egyptians and on their way to the
[land promised to Abraham](../The_Promise_Land).
As a first step of [God\'s Plan](../Gods_Plan) he entered into a
covenant with The Israelites saying:

```
"Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant then out of all nation you will be my treasured possession. Although the while earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."
EX 19:5-6 NIV
```

To obtain this The Israelites were given
[The Ten Commandments](../The_Ten_Commandments)
to follow.

```
    "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of
    Egypt, out of the land of slavery."
"You shall have no other gods before me.'
"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form
    of anything in heaven above or on earth beneath
    or in the waters below. You shall not bow down
    to them or worship them: for I, the LORD your
    God, am a ejalous God, punishing the children
    for the sin of the parents to the third and
    fourth generation of those who hate me, but
    showing love to a thousand generation of theose
    who love me and keep my commandments."
"You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God.
    for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who
    misuses his name."
"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six
    days you shall labor and do all your work, but
    the seventh is a sabbath to the LORD your God.
    On it you shall not do any work, neither you,
    nor your son or daughter, nor any foreighner
    residing in your town. For six days the Lord
    made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and
    all that is in them, but he rested on the
    seventh day. There fore the LORD blessed the
    Sabbath day and made it holy."
"Honor your father and your mother, so that you may
    live long in the land the LORD your God is giving
    you"
"You shall not murder."
"You shall not commit adultery."
"You shall not steal."
"You shall not give false testimony against your
    neighbor"
"You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall
    not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or
    gemale servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that
    belongs to your neighbor."

EX 20:2-17 NIV
