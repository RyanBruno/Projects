Gensis
===
---

Gensis means the beginnings. It tells the story of
[God\'s creation](../Gods_Creation) of the heavens and earth,
[Adam and Eve](../Adam_and_Eve),
[The Flood](../The_Flood),
[Abraham](../Abraham),
[Isaac](../Isaac), and
[Jacob and his sons](../Jacob).

#### God\'s Creation

---

The first sentence of the Bible are:

```
In the beginning God created the heaves and the earth.
GEN 1:1 NIV
```

He goes on to create light and dark,
the sky,
the land and seas and all vegetation,
the sun and moon and stars,
the birds and fish,
livestock and wild
animals,
and lastly, in his own image, he created [man](../Man).
These acts of creation lasted six days and on the
[seventh](../The_Sabbath) day God rested.
Of each creation God spoke them into existence.
However, of man God form him and breathed life into his nostrils.

```
Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrills the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
GEN 2:7 NIV
```

After each creation God looked upon them and saw that it was good.
However, Gods saw that man was very good. The first man God created was
named [Adam](../Adam_and_Eve) and after seeing that Adam needed a helper
he create Eve.

#### The Fall of Man

---

After God\'s creation the Adam and Eve were located in the
[Garden of Eden](../Garden_of_Eden); a beautiful garden of flowing
rivers, trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food.
Man kept the garden and was allow to eat any from any tree except one.

```
And the Lord God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."
GEN 2:16-17 NIV
```

Man walked along side God until the serpent, the
[devil](../Devil) in disguise, tricked the woman into
disobeying God.
The serpent tricked man into sinning against God by telling the woman
that they would gain the knowledge of God if they eat of the fruit.
Both the man and woman ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and their eyes were opened.
They were afraid of there nakedness and when God found what they have
done the man blamed the woman and the woman blamed the serpent.
God cursed the cured the serpent and [prophesized](../TBD) about the
coming of [Jesus](../Jesus).
God told man about the consequences of their actions including that
their labor would be tiresome, childbirth would be painful, wife and
husband would desire to rule over each other, and more.
The man and woman were then given their names;
[Adam and Eve](../Adam_and_Eve)
respectively.
Adam and Eve tried to cover themself with leaves but God gave them
garments made of animal skin instead.
God then stated that Adam and Eve could live in their sin forever if
they stated in The Garden and ate from the tree of life.
So God banished them from The Garden and guarded it with flaming swords.

#### Cain and Abel

---

[Cain and Abel](../Cain_and_Abel) were the direct descendants of Adam and
Eve.
The Bible tells us a story of when both Cain and Abel bring an offering
to God.
God took favor to Abel\'s offering over Cain\'s.
As a result Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him in an field.
It does not tell us what was wrong with Abel\'s offering.
Some believe either something was wrong with his offering or his
intentions.
God then curses Cain to being a restless wanderer on the earth.

#### Noah and The Flood

---

Descendants of Adam and Eve populate the earth over time.
God looks down on earth and sees that mankind is wicked in every
inclination.
[Noah](../Noah), a descendant of [Seth](../Seth) not Cain, was righteous
unlike the rest of mankind.
So God told Noah to build an ark and put himself, his wife, his three
sons, three daughter-in-laws, and two of every animal on the ark.
Then God sent a flood that destroyed all living things on the surface of
the ground.
After the waters retreated Noah made a sacrifice to God.
God was pleased and said:

```
"Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done."
GEN 8:21 NIV
```

From Noah, then again, humans populated the Earth.

#### Abram (Abraham)

---

After the Flood God entered into a covenant with [Abram](../Abraham).
Abram, like his family predecessor Noah, was a man of great faith.
God told Abram to leave his homeland and go to a land God will show.
God promised that he will make a great nation out of Abram if he does
so. This is the beginning of
[God\'s Plan](../Gods_Plan) to save the human race.

In Egypt, Abram lied to the Egyptians about his wife in order to save
his own life.
He did not trust God to protect him.
As a result Abram\'s wife, [Sarai](../Sarah), was barren.
Later, Abram saved his brother, [Lot](../Lot), in battle and God reassured
Abram that God was his shield and that he will one day have an heir of
his own flesh and blood.
However, Sarai was still barren so Abram slept with Sarai\'s slave
[Hagar](../Hagar).
She conceived and gave birth to [Ishmael](../Ishmael).
Sarai mistreated Hagar for having her husband\'s child but God reassured
and gave strength to Hagar.
Abram has a son but not with his wife Sarai.

God entered into another covenant with Abram.
God will make a great nation out of Abram and Sarai will give him a son.
But, Abram and his descendants must be circumcised.
God then stated that from then on Abram will also be called
[Abraham](../Abraham) and Sarai called [Sarah](../Sarah).
So Abraham and all other males of his family were circumcised.

Sarah was still barren and by now past the age of childbearing
but three visitors from God came to Abraham and his family.
They told him that by next year Sarah will have a son.
Sarah overheard this and laughed.
Abraham sinned against God again by lying but God is faithful to his
word.
So Sarah, in her old age, became pregnant with [Issac](../Issac).
Abraham finally had a son with his wife Sarah.

However, one day God called to
Abraham to sacrifice his son to God as a burnt offering.
Abraham brought his son and all the supplies to a mountain God showed
him.
Just he picked up the knife to slay his own son God stopped him.
God was testing Abraham and now knows he has the fear of God in him.

```
"I sware by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of thair enemies, and though your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."
GEN 22:16-17 NIV
```

God provided a ram in-place of Issac as an offering.

#### Issac

---

Issac sent his servant out and his servant, with the help of God, found a
woman named [Rebekah](../Rebekah) as a wife for Issac.
Rebekah became pregnant with twins [Jacob](../Jacob) and
[Esau](../Esau).
God came to Rebekah and said:

```
"Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be seperated; one people will be stonger then the other, and the older will serve the younger"
GEN 25:23 NIV
```

As God said Jacob, being the younger son, tricked Esau out of his
birthright and his blessing from Issac.
With his mother\'s advice Jacob feared Esau would try to kill him.
So he fled [Beersheba](../Beersheba) for [Harran](../Harren).

#### Jacob

---

Jacob\'s tricks are what led him to flee Beersheba for Harran.
Jacob stayed with a man named [Laben](../Laben), Rebekah\'s brother,
Jacob\'s uncle.
Laben tricked Jacob by telling Jacob he can have his daughter
[Rachel](../Rachel)
if Jacob worked for Laben for seven years.
At the end of seven years, Laben gave Jacob his older daughter
[Leah](../Leah) instead.
When Jacob discovered this he was upset but Laben told Jacob he may have
his other daughter Rachel as well if he worked for another seven years.
So Jacob do so and married both Leah and Rachel.

Both Leah and Rachel give Jacob [many sons](../Sons_of_Jacob).
After 20 years of service Jacob left Laben to return to his homeland
with his family.
The Lord called Jacob to leave as Laben\'s attitude towards Jacob
worsened.

Laben pursued Jacob after he left but once he overtook Jacob and his
relatives they, with Gods help, came to an agreement and made a
covenant.
As part of the covenant Jacob was not to take another wife other then
Laben\'s daughters.

Jacob prepared for a fight with his brother [Esau](../Esua) while also
splitting his tribe so one may escape an attack.
One night while they were traveling Jacob wrestled with God.
After hours of wrestling Jacob\'s hip was dislocated but he would not
give up until God blessed him.
So God said:

```
"Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome"
GEN 33:14 NIV
```

As a result Esau embraced Jacob instead of attacking him upon
meeting.
Jacob\'s twelve sons are the origin of the
[Twelve Tribes of Israel](../Twelve_Tribes_of_Israel)
which are sometime referred to as
[Israelites](../Israelites).

#### Joseph

---

[Joseph](../Joseph) was the most recent son of Jacob.
As such he was Jacob\'s favorite son and Jacob made an ornate robe for
him.

One day Joseph described two dream to his brother inferring that one day
all of his brothers would bow down to Joseph.
The brothers jealousy led them to sell Joseph into Egyptian slavery.

Joseph was brought into Egypt but the Lord was with him.
He had success in everything he did and was put in charge of his masters
household.
His master\'s wife wanted to sleep with Joseph but Joseph refused, as it
would be a sin.
However the master\'s wife told her husband Joseph slept with her
anyway.
So Joseph was thrown in jail.
But the Lord was still with him.

Years later and through a series of events Joseph was given the chance
to interpret dreams for the Pharaoh.
Joseph told the Pharaoh that Egypt would have seven years of abundance
followed by seven years of drought.

#### Themes and Patterns

---

**Creation Through Speech**

The Bible tells us God created all things through speech.
Perhaps Gods actions were actually something different then speech but
it was the closest word we can use to in our human languages.
The fact that God spoke all things into being shows God\'s power that he
did not even have to lift a finger to create the world.
It also tells us about our world.
God did not form the world with his hands or the [angels](../Angels) but
our world was created by the unbounded imagination of an all powerful God.
This encourages us to explore our world at any depth because all
depths were imagined and described by God.

**God\'s Own Image**

When God created man he created man "in his own image".
This means man and all of mankind were build with some properties of God
while not being God.
It is believed that man was created in God\'s images into to be God\'s
representative on earth.
This is also why we are gifted with our own [free will](../Free_Will).

**Man\'s Desire to Be Above God**

A common theme of the Bible are stories of mankind\'s desire to be above
God and the consequences that follow.
In Gensis, the first came when [the serpent](../The_Devil) tricked man
into thinking they would gain the knowledge of God if the ate from
[the tree of knowledge of good and evil](../The_Tree_of_Knowledge_of_Good_and_Evil).
It is also shown in the story of
[The Tower of Babel](../The_Tower_of_Babel).


**The Garden of Eden was not a Prison**

**Sacrifice**

**Punishment and Mercy**

**God Testing Abraham**

**God Humbling Jacob and Joseph**
