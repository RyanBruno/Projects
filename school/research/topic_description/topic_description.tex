\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
The general area that I am interested in researching relates to distributed systems. There is a theorem in distributed systems called the CAP theorem. It states a distributed system cannot guarantee both Consistency and Availability in the event of a network Partition. Most systems today choose Availability and strive to be "eventually consistent." My research would target a technique of building "eventually consistent" systems by using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). These data types not only provide techniques for reloving conflicts and maintaining consistency but provide a quality abstraction to a developer who wishes to use the data type without having to worry about the underlying mechanisms.
