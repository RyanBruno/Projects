Every man in the world who has the outdoor space to have one should own
a smoker.

Meat is best enjoyed when it is slowly roasted at 225, being infaltrated
with smoke, and rubbed with spices before hand.
When cooked slow the meat falls off the bone and just pulls right apart.
This page will give an introduction to the science of smoking meat
(also known as smokoligy).

You will need:
 - [ ] A Smoker
 - [ ] Meat to Smoke
 - [ ] Rub

##### Smoker

Smokers come is a few different types.
For example Electric, Gas, and Charcoal.
Out of all three, Electric smokers require the least amount of work
to start and operate.
This is because an Electric smoker will monitor the interal heat and
can raise or lower it heaters accordingly.
Gas and Charcoal smokers require you to either add more Charcoal or turn up the Gas.
For beginners, I highly recommend getting an Electric smoker.

There are other things to consider when choosing a smoker like size.
Some smokers cannot fit a full sized brisket while other can fit multiple.
You do not want to go to big as then you will be heating unused
space but here usually your budget comes into play here.
Understand that you can always cut the meat before you smoke it
(as a bonus this saves smoking time).
Features other then internal temperature thermometers and meat
probes can be ignored.

##### Smokoligy

Lets talk a little about what a smoker actually does.
The most important thing a smoker does is heat up your meat.
The smoke is secondary.
The smoker will heat up the main compartment where the meat is.
The heat source is sometime in a separate compartment called
the heat box but not always.
The meat will sit in the main compartment for hours usually
at the temperature of 225F.
This long process is what gives smoked meat that pull apart,
fall-off-the-bone characteristic.
As said before, smoke is secondary.
But it is important.
Wood chips are burned in the fire or next to the heat source.
The flavor from the wood chips stay in the smoke as it lingers in the main compartment to be sucked up by the meat.

##### Meat to Smoke

Below is an incomplete list meat you can smoke.
Remember you can smoke just about anything.
**Important** smoking time should only be used as an estimate.
The meat is done when it reaches the target temperature.
Invest in a good meat thermometer.

Beef

|Meat|Smoking Time|Target Temp|
|---|---|---|
|Brisket|12| Hours|200F|

Pork

|Meat|Smoking Time|Target Temp|
|---|---|---|
|Pork But|12| Hours|200F|
|Baby Back Ribs|6 Hours|200F|
|Spare Ribs|6 Hours|200F|

Chicken

|Meat|Smoking Time|Target Temp|
|---|---|---|
|Entire Chicken|4 Hours|165F|
|Chicken Legs|2 Hours|175F|
|Chicken Wings|2 Hours|175F|

##### Trimming

Some meat you buy from the store is not ready to be cooked and eaten
directly.
They leave it up to you to prepare the meat by removing fat and other
parts in a process called trimming.
Trimming does not need to be done on all meat but meat like brisket can
really be improved by the process of trimming.
Do some research on your meat before throwing it in the smoker on how to
trim your meat.
