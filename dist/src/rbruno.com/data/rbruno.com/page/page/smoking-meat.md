Every person in the world who has the outdoor space to have one should own a smoker.

Meat is best enjoyed when it is slowly roasted at 225, being infaltrated with smoke, and rubbed with spices before hand.
When cooked show the meat falls off the bone or just pulls right apart.
This page will give an introduction to the science of smoking meat (sometimes called smokoligy).

<h4>Smoker</h4>
Smokers come is a few different types.
For example Electric, Gas, and Charcoal.
Out of all three Electric smokers require the least amount of work to start and operate.
This is because an Electric smoker will monitor the interal heat and can raise or lower it heaters accordingly.
Gas and Charcoal smokers require you to either add more Charcoal or turn up the Gas.
For beginners I highly recommend getting an Electric smoker.

There are other things to consider when choosing a smoker like size.
Some smokers cannot fit a full sized brisket while other can fit multiple.
You do not want to go to big as then you will be heating un-used space but here usually your budget comes into play.
Understand that you can always cut the meat before you smoke it (as a bonus this saves smoking time).
Features other then interal tempeature thomoters and meat probes can be ignored.

Lets talk a little about what a smoker actually does.
The most important thing a smoker does is heat up your meat.
The smoke is secondary.
The smoker will heat up the main compartment where the meat is.
The heat source is sometime in a seperate compartment called the heat box but not always.
The meat will sit in the main compartment for hours usually at the tempeature of 225F.
This long process is what gives smoked meat that pull apart, fall-off-the-bone charastiic.
As said before, smoke is secondary.
But it is important.
Wood chips are placed next to the heat source and are burned.
The flavor from the wood chips stay in the smoke as it lingers in the main compartment to be sucked up by the meat.
This is the job of the smoker.
To give the meat the fall-off-the-bone charastiic by slowly cooking it at 225 and hammer the meat with flavored smoke to give the meat that signature smokey flavor.
